## Run List
This is an attempt to make a tool that takes CalTopo lines and generates a table with details about your runs to help with decision making on slope angles, aspects, etc.

## Snotel
This is a daily weather update presented in a form that I find useful for outdoor activities like backcountry skiing and alpine rock climbing. I have always used NOAA's forecast and it has great information, but I find the charts to be a bit hard to read and they are always spread out between multiple pages. This was an attempt to move everything into one big chart, displayed in a way that I find visually helpful, and sent to my email every day for my areas of interest. I have also found SNOTEL snowpack websites to be difficult to navigate, so I have included a chart of those snow depth readings for the nearest site to the area of interest.

Temperature is colored blue below freezing and red above freezing. Shading on the temperature chart is based on sun rise and sunset, which I find useful for finding perfect spring corn.

The snowfall chart displays total snowfall for the week as well as snowfall rate at any time.

The skycover plot displays skycover as blue above the line and gray below to make it easy to interpret whether it's clear or cloudy. Precipitation potential is overlaid as well here. I specifically added precip potential for summer alpine rock as I have come to understand the difference between 30, 40, and 50% chance of precip for front range Colorado.

Wind speed is plotted with wind direction displayed as an arrow and wind magnitude displayed as the y axis as well as the arrow color. Wind direction is essential for understanding terrain variability for avalanche conditions.
